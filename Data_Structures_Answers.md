Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `append` method?

O(1) always the same

2. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `append` function?

O(1) always the same

3. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?

O(n) size of self.storage

4. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?

O(1) always the same

5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?

O(n _ m) length of one list _ length of other list

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?

O(1) the binary search doesn't require additional memory.

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?

O(log n)

8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?

O(log n) - because my binary search includes recursion
